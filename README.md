### This is Xin Jing's coursework2 for 7CCSMSDV Simulation and Data Visualisation.

## Introduction:

When it comes to accommodation in tourism, most people will think about Airbnb, which highlights the current popularity of Airbnb. And in this coursework, I did some visualization using Airbnb data in London with some simple questions:
How many listings in London in each year between 2015-2019?
Average Price of Each Room Type in 2018?
Occupancy Rate by Months?

## Conclusion:

The number of Airbnb listings in London has grown significantly in the past few years. London has more than 80K different listings, which means that every square km there are 50 homes for rent on average. Airbnb connects people to unique travel experiences, at any price point, and anywhere on Earth. 
Learned a lot about D3, and I thought I made pretty good interface but can do more further visualization based on D3.
